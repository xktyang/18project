Title: Purca-pelago


Notes: This PD composition is created through a series of automated and manually controlled synthesizers and samplers. This piece is a blend of chaotic and atmospheric elements arranged to provide bursts of energy at inopportune times. There is ample usage of reverberation, double index FM modulation, and vibrato in the composition of the ambient component. Various percussion samples dot the composition with liveliness and abrupt rhythms.
